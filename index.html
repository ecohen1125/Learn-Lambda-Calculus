      <h1>What is Lambda Calculus?</h1>
      <h4>
        It is a way for mathematicians to express computations based on function abstraction and application using
        variable bindings and substitution.
      </h4>
      <h3>There are 3 terms that make up Lambda Calculus:</h3>
      <div class="center">
        <h3 class="left">1. x</h3>
        <h3 class="left">2. (λ (x) Body)</h3>
        <h3 class="left">3. (Rator Rand)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="center2">
        <h4 class="left">1. This is a variable which can be set to any value</h4>
        <h4 class="left">
          2. The second term is a lambda-abstraction, which takes in a variable (x in this example) and a body. The
          variable is typically in the format of number 1 in the list. The body can be another lambda function or even
          just some math using the created variable.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="left">
          3. The third term is an application of a function to an argument. It applies the first argument to the second
          argument. The first argument is typically a lambda function, and the second argument is typically a variable.
          This is not always the case, but it is the most common. It could be a lambda function applied to another
          lambda function.

      </div>
      <div class="examples">

        <br />
        You will be presented with a 4x4 grid. Some squares will be filled in with a lambda calculus expression. Your
        job is to apply an expression to a lambda expression in order to merge them into a higher value. They are in the
        style of 2040 so expext those numbers. You can only move the squares up, down, left, or right using WASD or the
        arrow keys. There will be a button in the bottom right corner that adds corresponding colors to each matching
        squares to make it easier to learn.

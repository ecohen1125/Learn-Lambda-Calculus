      <h1>What is Lambda Calculus?</h1>
      <h4>
        It is a way for mathematicians to express computations based on function
        abstraction and application using variable bindings and substitution.
      </h4>
      <h3>There are 3 terms that make up Lambda Calculus:</h3>
      <div class="center">
        <h3 class="left">1. x</h3>
        <h3 class="left">2. (λ (x) Body)</h3>
        <h3 class="left">3. (Rator Rand)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="center2">
        <h4 class="left">
          1. This is a variable which can be set to any value
        </h4>
        <h4 class="left">
          2. The second term is a lambda-abstraction, which takes in a variable
          (x in this example) and a body. The variable is typically in the
          format of number 1 in the list. The body can be another lambda
          function or even just some math using the created variable.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="left">
          3. The third term is an application of a function to an argument. It
          applies the first argument to the second argument. The first argument
          is typically a lambda function, and the second argument is typically a
          variable. This is not always the case, but it is the most common. It
          could be a lambda function applied to another lambda function.

        <br />
        You will be presented with a 4x4 grid. Some squares will be filled in
        with a square with a lambda calculus expression. Your job is to put
        expression together that hae the same values to merge them into one with
        a higher value. You can only move the squares up, down, left, or right
        using WASD or the arrow keys. You can click on a square to reaveal what
        it evaluates to for help. There will be a button in the bottom right
        corner that adds corresponding colors to each matching squares.
        <br />
        <center>Good Luck!</center>
